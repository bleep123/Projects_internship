                    Frontend web development involves giving an outer appearance to a website. In this, we build the structure of a website and add styles and animations to it. It is relatively easier as compared to backend web development.
                    
                    Technologies to begin with frontend web development:
                    
                    HTML
                    
                    CSS
                    
                    JAVASCRIPT
                    
                    Frontend frameworks and libraries:
                    
                    Bootstrap
                    
                    React.js
                    
                    AngularJs
                    
                    Vue.Js
                    
                    jQuery
                    
                    Backend web development involves building and maintaining the back end of a website, i.e., working with the server side of a website. We don't interact directly with it. It stores and maintains data.
                    
                    Technologies to begin with backend web development:
                    
                    Node.js
                    
                    PHP
                    
                    JAVA
                    
                    PYTHON
                    
                    Backend frameworks and libraries:
                    
                    Django
                    
                    Express.js
                    
                    Ruby on Rails
                    
                    Laravel
                    
                    Flask</p>
